Detailed instructions on how to play:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gameplay of this table can be divided into its features, each of which shall be explained here.

Tower Checkpoint:
The large bank of ten drop targets in the center of the cabinet are linked to the purple Tower Checkpoint lights in front. The game will start with checkpoint one flashing by default, and once completed, will advance to checkpoint two. Completing the targets again will activate checkpoint three, and one more time will reset the sequence. Each time you advance the checkpoint, you will earn an increasing amount of points: 10000 for checkpoint one, 30000 for #2 and 70000 for #3.
Advancing checkpoint past three is one of three objectives needed to light The central spot target for an extra ball.

Special Gauge:
The prominent sequence of orange lights on the center of the playing field function as a Bonus counter. Each individual orange light is worth 50000 on your end of ball bonus. This leaves you with a max bonus of 1150000 points. Any targets, bumpers, and gates will contribute to filling the gauge. (Some more then others.) Once the gauge is full it will light the central 
spot target for 3-ball instant multiball. When multiball is activated your ball will drain, and after you plunge it two other balls will enter the playing field. When you have one ball left on the playfield, your bonus will score, allowing you to fill it again.

Gear Ability Reroller:
The three black and white question marks near your flippers can be rolled for a chance at double, even TRIPLE- scoring. To gain access to this feature, you must first complete the lane lights in the inlanes and outlanes. These can be rotated left or right with the flippers. Once all the lane lights are lit, The spinner will be lit to reroll your gear abilities. If you roll two of the same ability, double scoring will light. If you roll three of the same ability, triple scoring will light. If you didn't roll any doubles, you have five seconds to shoot the spinner again to keep it on rolling. Note that scoring multipliers apply to all objects on the table, but not to increasing your bonus.

Bumper Hit Bonus:
Each hit on any of the pop bumpers brings you one hit closer to the jacpot of 53333 points. The number of hits needed to earn the jackpot does NOT reset after each game, so use that to your advantage. This is one of three objectives you must complete to light the central spot target for an extra ball.

Clam Blitz Jackpot:
When you enter the upper deck that is located above the left lanes via the ramp near the back of the cabinet, all table lights will go off and new music will play. From here, your mission is simple: Hit the target as many times as you can before you fall out. Each hit will bring you three points closer to a KO jackpot, and each time you enter the area will score 20. The number of hits needed to earn the jackpot does NOT reset after each game, so use that to your advantage. This is one of three objectives that must be compleated to light the central spot target for an extra ball.

2 Banks of spot targets on the upper and lower areas:
This is the alternative way to light the central spot target for an extra ball. hitting a target will cause its associated light to flash, and hitting it again will turn it off. Once all targets in a bank are flashing, the bank will be complete and be unsusceptible to any further tampering. Once both banks are complete, The extra ball will be available.

Kicksaves (non-traditional):
This table features different kicksaves than you're probably used to. The right rail activates the right one and you could probably guess that the left rail lights- you know what I'm about to say. When your ball goes down the outlane, it will lock into a kicker beneath your flipper. You will need to raise your flipper so that the ball can be safely launched through that space. If you die when a kicksave is lit, You will be allowed to plunge straight to the upper deck and avoid purgutory. 

Look at the script if you want to begin to try and understand the exact points associated with things. Best of luck to you; my variable naming convention sucks.
